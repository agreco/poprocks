## Pop Rocks

Pop Rocks is a low contrast dark theme for Sublime, Textmate, Emacs, and XCode.  The colors were inspired by Hardcore's [iTerm colors](https://github.com/hardcore/iTerm-colors), and [Pop Rocks](http://www.pop-rocks.com/) the candy.

## Sublime Text / Textmate

The TmTheme color scheme is based off settings found in Cobalt, and was created with the awesome [TmTheme-Editor](http://tmtheme-editor.herokuapp.com).  Looks best with the dark theme from [Soda](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/).
